# Material UI Example

This is a simple demonstration of how to connect all the standard
[material-ui](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui) form elements to `redux-form`.

For the most part, it is a matter of wrapping each form control in a `<Field>`
component as custom component.

For controls like `SelectField` we need to simulate the `onChange` manually. As props
have been exposed in `redux-form` you can fire `onChange` manually.

The delay between when you click "Submit" and when the alert dialog pops up is intentional,
to simulate server latency.
