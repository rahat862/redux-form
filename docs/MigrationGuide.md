# `v5` â†’ `v6` Migration Guide

`redux-form` has been _completely_ rewritten for `v6`, because of a fundamental design change.

## Inversion of Control

In `v5`, only the outer form component was connected to the Redux state, and the props for each 
field were passed in via the form component. The problem with this is that the _entire_ form 
component had to rerender _on every single keypress_ that changed a form value. This was fine for
small login forms, but lead to extremely slow performance on larger forms with dozens or hundreds
of fields.

**In `v6`, every single field is connected to the Redux store.** The outer form component is also
connected, but is connected in such a manner that does not require it to refresh every time a 
value changes.

Because of this inversion of control, **there is no incremental upgrade path**. I would love to 
provide new API and provide deprecation warnings on the old API, but there is just no path from 
here to there that allows for such a transition.

The `v6` `Field` API was designed, however, in such a way as to minimize the migration pains. 
This document will outline the minimum migration distance from `v5` to `v6`.

## Goodbye `fields`... Hello `Field`!

In `v5`, you were required to provide an array of `fields` names, and then a `fields` object prop 
was provided to your decorated component. The mechanism that generates the props (`value`,
`onChange`, `onBlur`, etc.) for your input from the string name of your field is the new `Field` 
component.

#### `v5`

To illustrate how minimal a breaking change this is, I have marked each line that does *NOT* 
change between `v5` and `v6` with an arrow.

      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>                        // <--

    )
  }
}

export default reduxForm({                                  // <--
  form: 'myForm',                                           // <--
  fields: [ 'username', 'password' ]
})(MyForm)                                                  // <--
```

#### `v6`

The lines with comments are **the only ones** that are different.

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import { reduxForm, Field } from 'redux-form' // imported Field

class MyForm extends Component {
  render() {
  
    const { handleSubmit } = this.props       // no fields prop
    
    return (
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      
        <Field                                // wrap in Field
          name="username"                     // specify field name
          component={username =>              // specify how to render, given props
            <div>
              <label>Username</label>
              <input type="text" {...username}/>
              {username.touched &&
               username.error &&
               <span className="error">{username.error}</span>}
            </div>
          }/>                                 // close Field
          
        <Field                                // wrap in Field
          name="password"                     // specify field name
          component={password =>              // specify how to render, given props
            <div>
              <label>Password</label>
              <input type="password" {...password}/>
              {password.touched &&
               password.error &&
               <span className="error">{password.error}</span>}
            </div>
          }/>                                 // close Field
        
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </form>
    )
  }
}

export default reduxForm({
  form: 'myForm'
                                              // no fields array given
})(MyForm)
```

In `v5` the field name strings were all bundled together as input and the field objects came out
bundled together as output (of `redux-form`), and now, in `v6`, the conversion from field name to 
field object is done one at a time at the location of each field.

## `handleSubmit` and `onSubmit`

The only thing that has changed about form submission is that your submit validation 
errors must now be wrapped in a `SubmissionError` object. This is to distinguish between 
validation errors and AJAX or server errors.
[See discussion on PR #602](https://github.com/erikras/redux-form/pull/602)

#### `v5`

```js
<MyForm onSubmit={values =>
  ajax.send(values) // however you send data to your server...
    .catch(error => {
      // how you pass server-side validation errors back is up to you
      if(error.validationErrors) {
        return Promise.reject(error.validationErrors)
      } else {
        // what you do about other communication errors is up to you
        reportServerError(error)
      }
    })
}/>
```

#### `v6`

```js
<MyForm onSubmit={values =>
  ajax.send(values)
    .catch(error => {
      if(error.validationErrors) {
        throw new SubmissionError(error.validationErrors) // <----- only difference
      } else {
        reportServerError(error)
      }
    })
}/>
```

## Sync Validation

Sync validation is exactly the same as in `v5`. The only small difference is that if you are 
using ImmutableJS, the `values` given to your sync validation function will be an an
`Immutable.Map`. The errors returned, however, should be a in a plain JS object, like always.

## Initialization with `initialValues`

Nothing has changed with this, apart from fixing some pesky bugs like 
[#514](https://github.com/erikras/redux-form/issues/514),
[#621](https://github.com/erikras/redux-form/issues/621),
[#628](https://github.com/erikras/redux-form/issues/628), and
[#756](https://github.com/erikras/redux-form/issues/756). In `v6`, each field will have its 
initial value on the very first render.

## Async Validation

No changes. Works exactly like `v5`.

## Deep Fields

There is no mystery to deep fields in `v6`. You simply use dot-syntax on your field name.

#### `v5`

```js
render() {
  const { 
    fields: {
      contact: {
        shipping: { street }
      }
    }
  } = this.props
  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" {...street}/>
    </div>
  )  
}
```

#### `v6`

```js
render() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Field name="contact.shipping.street" component={street =>
        <input type="text" {...street}/>
      }/>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Field Arrays

To get the field array object that was passed as a prop to the whole form in `v5`, you must use 
the `FieldArray` component, much like the `Field` component is used.

#### `v5`

```js
render() {
  const { fields: { awards } } = this.props;
  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {awards.map((award, index) => <li key={index}>
          <label>Award #{index + 1}</label>
          <input type="text" {...award}/>
        </li>}
      </ul>
      <button onClick={() => awards.addField()}>Add Award</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

#### `v6`

```js
render() {
  return (
    <div>
      <FieldArray name="awards" component={awards =>
        <div>
          <ul>
            {awards.map((name, index) => <li key={index}>
              <label>Award #{index + 1}</label>
              <Field name={name} type="text" component="input"/>
            </li>}
          </ul>
          <button onClick={() => awards.push()}>Add Award</button>
        </div>
      }/>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Normalization

Not implemented yet.

## Listening to other actions

No equivalent of the `v5` `plugin()` interface has been written yet.
