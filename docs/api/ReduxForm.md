# `reduxForm(config:Object)`

Creates a decorator with which you use `redux-form` to connect your form component to Redux.
It takes a `config` parameter which lets you configure your form.

## Importing

```javascript
var reduxForm = require('redux-form').reduxForm;  // ES5
```
```javascript
import { reduxForm } from 'redux-form';  // ES6
```

## Config Properties

**IMPORTANT: All of these configuration options may be passed into `reduxForm()` at "design time"
or passed in as props to your component at runtime.**

### Required

#### `form : String` [required]

> the name of your form and the key to where your form's state will be mounted under the
`redux-form` reducer

### Optional

#### -`adapter : (component:String, props:Object) => ReactElement` [optional]

> An adapter function that will render a component based on a string component type and the props
given to a `Field`. An example can be found in the
[`redux-form-material-ui`](https://github.com/erikras/redux-form-material-ui) library.

Defaults to `[]`.

> See [Asynchronous Blur Validation Example](../../examples/asyncValidation) for more 
details.

#### -`asyncBlurFields : Array<String>` [optional]

> field names for which `onBlur` should trigger a call to the `asyncValidate` function.
Defaults to `[]`.

> See [Asynchronous Blur Validation Example](../../examples/asyncValidation) for more 
details.

#### `asyncValidate : (values:Object, dispatch:Function, props:Object) => Promise<undefined, errors:Object>` [optional]

> a function that takes all the form values, the `dispatch` function, and the `props` given
to your component, and 
returns a Promise that will resolve if the validation is passed, or will reject with an
object of validation errors
in the form `{ field1: <String>, field2: <String> }`.

> See [Asynchronous Blur Validation Example](../../examples/asynchronous-blur-validation) for more 
details.

#### `destroyOnUnmount : boolean` [optional]

> Whether or not to automatically destroy your form's state in the Redux store when your
component is unmounted. Defaults to `true`.

#### `getFormState : Function` [optional]

> A function that takes the entire Redux state and returns the state slice which corresponds to 
where the `redux-form` reducer was mounted. This functionality is rarely needed, and defaults to
assuming that the reducer is mounted under the `form` key.

#### `initialValues : Object<String, String>` [optional]

> The values with which to initialize your form in `componentWillMount()`. Particularly useful when
[Editing Multiple Records](../../examples/multirecord), but can also be used with single-record 
forms. The values 
should be in the form `{ field1: 'value1', field2: 'value2' }`.

#### `onSubmit : Function` [optional]

> The function to call with the form data when the `handleSubmit()` is fired from within the
form component. If you do not specify it as a prop here, you must pass it as a parameter to
`handleSubmit()` inside your form component.

> If your `onSubmit` function returns a promise, the `submitting` property will be set to
`true` until the promise has been resolved or rejected. If it is rejected with a
`redux-form` `SubmissionError` containing errors in the form
`{ field1: 'error', field2: 'error' }` then the submission errors will be added to each field
(to the `error` prop) just like async validation errors are. If there is an error that is not
specific to any field, but applicable to the entire form, you may pass that as if it were the
error for a field
called `_error`, and it will be given as the `error` prop.

#### `propNamespace : string` [optional]

**UNIMPLEMENTED SO FAR IN V6**

> If specified, all the props normally passed into your decorated component directly will be passed
under the key specified. Useful if using other decorator libraries on the same component to avoid
prop namespace collisions.

#### `returnRejectedSubmitPromise : boolean` [optional]

> If set to `true`, a failed submit will return a rejected promise. Defaults to `false`. Only use this if you need to
detect submit failures and run some code when a submit fails.

#### `shouldAsyncValidate(params) : boolean` [optional]

> An optional function you may provide to have full control over when async validation happens.
Your `shouldAsyncValidate()` function will be given an object with the following values:

> ##### `asyncErrors : Object` [optional]

> Any existing asynchronous validation errors

> ##### `initialized : boolean` [required]

> `true` if the form has ever been initialized with initial values

> ##### `trigger : String` [required]

> The reason to possibly run async validation. It will either be: `'blur'` or `'submit'`, 
depending on whether an async blur field had triggered the async validation or if submitting the 
form has triggered it, respecitively.

> ##### `blurredField : string` [optional]

> The name of the field that has triggered the async validation. May be `undefined`.

> ##### `pristine : boolean` [required]

> `true` if the form is pristine, `false` if it is dirty

> ##### `syncValidationPasses : boolean` [required]

> `true` if synchronous validation is passing, `false` if it is failing.

> The default behavior is:

> ```js
  if(!syncValidationPasses) {
    return false
  }
  switch(trigger) {
    case 'blur':
      // blurring
      return true
    case 'submit':
      // submitting, so only async validate if form is dirty or was never initialized
      // conversely, DON'T async validate if the form is pristine just as it was initialized
      return !pristine || !initialized
    default:
      return false
  }
```

#### `touchOnBlur : boolean` [optional]

> marks fields as `touched` when the blur action is fired. Defaults to `true`.

#### `touchOnChange : boolean` [optional]

> marks fields as `touched` when the change action is fired. Defaults to `false`.

#### `validate : (values:Object, props:Object) => errors:Object` [optional]

> a synchronous validation function that takes the form values and props passed into your component.
If validation passes, it should return `{}`. If validation fails, it should return the validation errors in the
form `{ field1: <String>, field2: <String> }`. Defaults to `(values, props) => ({})`.

> See [Synchronous Validation Example](../../examples/syncValidation) for more details.
